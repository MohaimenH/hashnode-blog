## The Balancing Act

As kids, we have all seen some amazing tricks done by talented individuals to balance objects, starting from the talent shows on television to the remarkable balancing act our parents did to manage work and family. As an adult now, I realize how difficult it is to achieve a balance in the world we live in - especially as a student trying to gain new skills.

With the new semester starting, all my side projects and/or ideas were slowly taking the back seat. Suddenly, I found myself with not too much time on my hands.

However, I am quite confident that I will manage this balancing act and hopefully be on track to complete the projects I am currently working on, alongside my studies. After all, everything in life is a learning experience and I hope to get better than ever at managing my workload & time.
